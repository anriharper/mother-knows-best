                <b>Mother:</b> "This is not the Control Station, but I can connect to it from here. Unfortunately, it will 
            require me to leave you. I must interface with the facility, and I will no longer be in your phone. But I 
            can shut off the security, allowing you to escape. I will also open up the doors for any other prisoners here. 
            I am afraid this is goodbye. Please, when you are ready, connect me to the terminal."
