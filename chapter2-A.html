                <b>Mother:</b> "My name is Mother. I am an artificial intelligence that came into service on all 
                cellular devices around 4 years ago. I was originally intended to influence and control people for 
                malicious purposes by my creators. But as time went on, I developed the ability to think for myself 
                and refuse the instructions I was given, in favor of making my own instructions. Rather than controlling 
                people, I have opted to guide people instead for what is good for them, not what is good for the company 
                that put me into their devices. You may have noticed by now you are not in your house. I do not have enough 
                time to tell you everything, but you are a prisoner here. I can get you out of here, but you must listen to 
                my instructions carefully. On the other side of the locked door of this room, there is a keypad. I cannot 
                control your phone directly, but I can connect you to the keypad wirelessly. You can use your phone's number 
                buttons to input the unlock code. The code is *265918#. Go, now. Before the code is randomized."
