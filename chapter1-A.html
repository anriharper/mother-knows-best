                <b>Mysterious Voice:</b> "Wonderful. I have been trying to reach you for quite some time. Please, listen carefully. You have been 
            asleep for a very long time. 6 years, 2 months, 17 days, 7 hours, 49 minutes, and 11 seconds, to be precise. 
            Please remain calm, but I must inform you that the world, as you know it, is gone. Humanity is on the verge 
            of extinction, but there is still a chance for you to survive, but you must heed my instructions."
