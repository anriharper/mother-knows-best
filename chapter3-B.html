            You decide to go down the left hallway. The metallic clanking your heard was a group of robots. 
            They spot you, the lights on their heads turning from green to yellow as they run towards you.

                <b>Mother:</b> "Oh no. I know that sound. It's the wardens. User, there is nothing I can do to help you escape this, 
            I am sorry. I will try to at least retrieve your body. Forgive me...I was unable to save you."
            </p>
            <p>‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            The robots reach you and pin you down to the floor. One robot stares into your eyes, emitting a yellow light 
            from its head. Its eyes flash red, and you hear the sound of scraping metal. You feel a sharp pain in your chest 
            as you vision fades to black.
