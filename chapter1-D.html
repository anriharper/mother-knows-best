            The door of the room opens. Two robots come into your room. One holds you down to the bed, while the other stares 
            into your eyes, emitting a yellow light from its head. Its eyes flash red, and you hear the sound of scraping metal. 
            You feel a sharp pain in your chest as you vision fades to black.
