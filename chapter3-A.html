            An affirmative bleep is heard as the door slides open. There is a hallway travelling 
            perpendicular to your room. You go down the hall and it splits into a left and right hallway.

            and shut down the main system. I cannot see the Control Station in my scans of this facility, as I do 
            not have clearance. You will need to find it yourself. I believe in you. Good luck."

            To the left, you hear a rhythmic metallic clanking. In front of you, you see a doorway that opens up to a 
            much larger area. To your right, you see a locked door.
