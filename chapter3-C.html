            You go straight down the hallway towards the open door. As you go through, you find yourself 
            in a very large greenhouse atrium full of plants. There seem to be several hundreds of floors 
            both above and below your position, each floor having around twenty doors surrounding the atrium 
            opening, all open like the one you came from.
        </p>

        <div class='bg-black text-green comp-font small-text'>

                <b>Mother:</b> "Wait. What is this place? The schematics for this facility do not have anything to suggest a room like this exists. 
            This room is far too big, this can't be right."
            </p>
            <p>‎‏‏‎ ‎</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            All of the doors close, and the atrium's opening closes with a metal barrier. 
        </p>

        <div class='bg-red comp-font small-text'>
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎</p>
            <p class='padding'>
                <b>Facility:</b> "Warning: Containment breach located in Sector 164, Atrium level. Attempting re-containment."
            </p>

        </div>

        <p>
            You hear fans activating in the room. The plants begin to whither as you start to cough and fall to your knees. Your vision fades to black. 
            As your vision is fading, Mother calls out:
        </p>

        <div class='bg-black text-green comp-font small-text'>
            <p>‏‏‎ ‎</p>
            <p class='padding'>
                <b>Mother:</b> "What is happening over there? Hello? Can you hear me?"
